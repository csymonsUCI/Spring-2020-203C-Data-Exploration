**Introduction to the Tidyverse in R: methods for data wrangling, transformation and visualization**

##What is the Tidyverse?
Before you can conduct any analyses or draw any conclusions, you often need to reorganize your data. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages built around the basic concept that data in a table should have one observation per row, one variable per column, and only one value per cell. The Tidyverse consists of packages that work in harmony as part of a larger data analysis pipeline to clean, process, model, and visualize data.

##What does the Tidyverse help with?

Data manipulation (dplyr, tidyr)
Working with data types (stringr for strings, lubridate for date/datetime, forcats for categorical/factors)
Data visualization (ggplot2)
Data-oriented programming (purrr, tidyeval)
Communication (Rmarkdown, shiny)

For this seminar we will work through Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund’s  book “R for Data Science” https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

From the authors: “This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data.”

**Format:** We will have weekly meetings to discuss the assigned chapter(s), exercises, and applications to our own data. Each week will be led by a different participant, summarizing the chapter and demonstrating the techniques using their own data (if you don’t have your own data there are plenty of open access datasets to explore). This format will allow us to (1) learn to use the tidyverse, (2) think about how to apply these techniques to our own data (clean up our code!) and (3) learn about each other’s data and form a community of R/tidyverse users.

##Meeting time: Wednesdays 10:00-10:50, Steinhaus 267
